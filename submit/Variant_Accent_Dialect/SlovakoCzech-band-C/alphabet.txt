# This is a czecho-slovak (or slovako-czech, if You want;) alphabet obtained as a union of slovak and czech alphabets.
# Note that to in order to reduce somewhat the number of output neurons
# 1) czech ů is missing but can be easily obtained as ú which does not occur at initial position of the word, e.g. by applying the regex substitution s/(?<!^)ú/ů/g
# 2) slovak ĺ is missing but can be easily obtained from ll by applying the regex substitution s/ll/ĺ/g
